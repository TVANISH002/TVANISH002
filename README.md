# 👋 Hi, I’m Anish  
🎓 **M.S. Computer Science — University of Florida, USA**

I’m a Computer Science graduate focused on building **practical, end-to-end data science and machine learning systems**, with an emphasis on **problem framing, model evaluation, and deployment**.

Rather than focusing only on improving metrics, I’m interested in **why models work, where they fail, and how design and evaluation choices affect real-world use**.

Most of my experience comes from **project-based learning**, where I work across the ML pipeline — from data preparation and validation to model training, evaluation, and serving predictions through simple applications and APIs.

## 🔧 What I Work With

- **Backend & APIs:** FastAPI, REST APIs  
- **Data Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)  
- **Machine Learning:** Classification, regression, model evaluation  
- **Time Series:** Statistical forecasting (ARIMA, ETS / Holt–Winters)  
- **Visualization & Apps:** Streamlit  
- **Deployment & Tooling:** Docker, MLflow, AWS (basic deployments)  
- **Tools & Databases:** Git, SQL (MySQL), Jupyter Notebook  

*(All tools used in project and academic settings.)*

## 📌 Selected Projects

### 🩺 Diabetes Risk Screening  
Screening-style ML system designed to prioritize recall over accuracy.  
Includes structured preprocessing, evaluation using ROC-AUC and Precision–Recall, and a deployed Streamlit application to demonstrate practical usage.

---

### ✈️ Airline Demand Forecasting  
Time-series forecasting project comparing baseline, statistical, and ML-based approaches.  
Focused on **leakage-safe evaluation** using walk-forward validation and error metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.

---

### 🔁 Customer Churn Prediction  
ANN-based churn risk prediction project with reproducible preprocessing and inference.  
Explored model trade-offs rather than optimizing a single metric.

---

### 🛒 FastAPI E-commerce Backend  
Backend-driven product management application built with FastAPI and exposed through REST endpoints, paired with a simple Streamlit frontend.

---

### 📚 Data Science & ML Learning Lab  
Collection of notebooks covering EDA, feature engineering, clustering, and model comparison.  
Used as a sandbox for experimenting and documenting learning.
