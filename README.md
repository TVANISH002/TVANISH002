# 👋 Hi, I'm Anish Tirumala Venkata (TV Anish)

🎓 **M.S. in Computer Science** – University of Florida  
📍 United States  
🚀 **Aspiring Data Scientist | Analytics Engineer | ML & GenAI Enthusiast**

I’m a Computer Science graduate student at the University of Florida who enjoys working with data, machine learning, and analytics. I like turning messy datasets into clear insights and building small end-to-end projects that actually run.

Most of my work here is hands-on and project-driven — from data analysis and machine learning models to simple web apps for demonstrations.

### What I work on
- Data analysis using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Machine learning for classification and prediction problems
- NLP and deep learning experiments
- Dashboards and business analytics using Power BI
- Small deployed apps using Streamlit

### Featured projects

- **Data Science Learning Lab** – A collection of Jupyter notebooks covering EDA, machine learning algorithms, and hands-on experiments
-  **Diabetes Risk Screening (ML)** – End-to-end ML project with model training, evaluation, and a Streamlit app  
- **Customer Churn Prediction** – Predicting customer exit using structured data and neural networks  
- **IMDB Sentiment Analysis** – NLP project using deep learning for sentiment classification  
- **Business Insights Dashboard** – Power BI dashboard for KPI tracking and reporting  

### Tech I use
Python • SQL • Scikit-learn • TensorFlow • Power BI • Git • Jupyter  

Still learning, building, and improving — one project at a time 🙂
