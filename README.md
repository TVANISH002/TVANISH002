# 👋 Hi, I’m Anish  
🎓 **Recent Computer Science Graduate (Dec 2025)**  
🎓 **M.S. Computer Science — University of Florida, USA**

I’m a recent Computer Science graduate focused on building **practical, end-to-end machine learning systems** — from **problem framing and evaluation** to **deployment and API-based inference**.

Rather than chasing metrics in isolation, I care about **why models work, where they fail, and how design choices affect real-world use**.

Most of my experience comes from **project-based learning**, where I work across the full ML lifecycle: data validation, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and serving predictions through simple applications and APIs.

## 🔧 What I Work With

- **Backend & APIs:** FastAPI, REST  
- **Data Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)  
- **Machine Learning:** Classification, regression, model evaluation  
- **Time Series:** ARIMA, ETS / Holt–Winters  
- **Visualization & Apps:** Streamlit  
- **MLOps & Deployment:** Docker, MLflow, GitHub Actions, AWS (basic)  
- **Tools & Databases:** Git, SQL (MySQL), Jupyter Notebook  

*(Used in academic and project settings.)*

## 📌 Selected Projects

### 🔐 Network Security / Phishing Detection (ML + MLOps)
End-to-end machine learning system for detecting phishing websites using URL- and domain-based features.

- Built a **modular ML pipeline** covering data ingestion, validation, transformation, and training  
- Trained and compared multiple classifiers; selected final model based on **F1-score** (balanced precision–recall)  
- Tracked experiments, metrics, and artifacts using **MLflow** for reproducibility  
- Deployed the trained model behind a **FastAPI inference service** with schema validation and confidence scores  
- Added **GitHub Actions CI** to verify builds and dependencies  

📊 **Best validation performance:**  
**F1 ≈ 0.99 | Precision ≈ 0.99 | Recall ≈ 0.99**

⚠️ *Educational project — not a production security system.*

### 🩺 Diabetes Risk Screening (ML + Backend)
Screening-style ML system designed to **prioritize recall over accuracy** for early risk identification.

- Structured preprocessing with leakage-aware evaluation  
- Model selection using **ROC-AUC and Precision–Recall analysis**  
- Deployed via **FastAPI backend** with a **Streamlit frontend**  
- Designed as a **risk screening tool**, not a diagnostic system  

---

### ✈️ Airline Demand Forecasting
Time-series forecasting project comparing baseline, statistical, and ML approaches.

- Evaluated forecasts using **walk-forward validation** to prevent data leakage  
- Compared ARIMA, ETS (Holt–Winters), and ML baselines  
- Assessed performance with **RMSE, MAE, and MAPE**  

---

### 🔁 Customer Churn Prediction
ANN-based churn risk prediction system focused on **model trade-offs**, not single-metric optimization.

- Reproducible preprocessing and inference pipeline  
- Explored precision–recall and business impact of misclassification  

---

### 🛒 FastAPI E-commerce Backend
Backend-driven product management application.

- Built REST APIs using **FastAPI**  
- Paired with a lightweight **Streamlit frontend**  
- Emphasized clean API design and backend-first architecture  

---

### 📚 Data Science & ML Learning Lab
Notebook collection for hands-on experimentation.

- EDA, feature engineering, clustering, and model comparison  
- Used as a sandbox for documenting learning and trade-offs
