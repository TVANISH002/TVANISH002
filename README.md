👋 Hi, I’m Anish  
🎓 M.S. in Computer Science — University of Florida, USA  

I build practical, end-to-end data science and machine learning systems with a strong
focus on **problem framing, model evaluation, and deployment**.

I’m particularly interested in **why models work, where they fail, and how to design
them responsibly for real-world use** and not just improving metrics.

### 🔧 What I Work With
- **Backend & APIs:** FastAPI, RESTful API development, service-layer architecture
- **Data Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning:** Classification, regression, model evaluation
- **Deep Learning & NLP:** Neural networks, basic sentiment analysis
- **Analytics & BI:** Power BI dashboards, KPI reporting
- **Application Deployment:** Streamlit (interactive data-driven apps)
- **Tools & Databases:** Git, SQL (MySQL), Jupyter Notebook

### 📌 Selected Projects
- **Diabetes Risk Screening**  
  Screening-style ML system with recall-focused evaluation and a deployed Streamlit app.

- **Airline Demand Forecasting**  
  Time-series forecasting using statistical models and ML with realistic, leakage-safe evaluation.

- **Customer Churn Prediction**  
  ANN-based churn risk prediction with reproducible preprocessing and inference.

- **FastApi Ecommerce**  
  Backend-driven product management application built using FastAPI with a simple Streamlit frontend. 

- **Data Science & ML Learning Lab**  
  Hands-on notebooks covering EDA, clustering, feature engineering, and model comparison.
