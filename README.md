👋 Hi, I’m Anish  
🎓 M.S. in Computer Science — University of Florida, USA  

I build practical, end-to-end data science and machine learning systems with a focus on
problem framing, model evaluation, and deployment.

My work spans exploratory data analysis, classical ML, deep learning, and lightweight
deployments that turn models into usable applications.
