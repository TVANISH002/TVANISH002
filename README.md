💡 **From Code to Clarity: My Journey**  
With a background in Computer Science, I explored different areas of tech — but what truly inspired me was how data can shape decisions and solve real-world problems.

I realized that I don’t just enjoy writing code — I love finding patterns, asking the right questions, and helping teams understand the “why” behind the numbers. That’s what led me to Data Analytics — a space where I can bring together **tech, logic, and business**.

📚 **Currently Learning**  
- 📊 Excel (Advanced formulas, dashboards, KPI tracking)  
- 📈 Power BI (DAX, data modeling, drill-down reports)  
- 🧮 Python for EDA (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- 🗃️ SQL (Joins, CTEs, aggregations)  
- 💼 Business domain knowledge (KPIs, market metrics, finance)

> I'm not just learning tools — I'm learning how businesses work, what metrics matter, and how to tell the story behind the data.

💼 **Projects I'm Proud Of**
